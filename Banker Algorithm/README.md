# Banker's Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to the Banker's Algorithm project! This implementation is designed for a Linux environment.

## Project Overview

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It is used to manage the allocation of resources to processes in a way that avoids deadlocks and ensures the system's safety.

## Project Structure

- **main.c**: The main implementation of the Banker's Algorithm, including functions for initialization, displaying system information, and checking for system safety.

## Features

- Implementation of Banker's Algorithm
- Resource allocation and deadlock avoidance
- Read input from text files for different test cases
- [Add more features here]

## Getting Started

To get started with the Banker's Algorithm implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git@github.com:Mohamed-Badr-Saad/Operating-Systems.git
    cd "Bankers Algorithm"
    ```

2. Compile the program:

    ```bash
    gcc Banker_Algorithm.c -o bankers_algorithm
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    ./bankers_algorithm
    ```

4. Enter the test case number when prompted.

## Usage

Once the program is running, enter the test case number to analyze the system's safety based on Banker's Algorithm. The program reads input from text files (TestFile1.txt and TestFile2.txt) for different test cases.
